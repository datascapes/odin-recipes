        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup milk</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. </li>
            <li>Combine milk, oil, and egg in a small bowl until well blended. Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl, making a well in the center. Pour milk mixture into well and stir until batter is just combined; fold in chocolate chips. </li>
            <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Mix 3 tablespoons white sugar and brown sugar together in a small bowl; sprinkle on tops of muffins. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or cool completely.</li>
