            <li>Combine rice and water in a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once water is boiling, reduce heat to low and cook until water is completely absorbed, 12 to 13 minutes. Remove from the heat; keep covered and steam for another 10 minutes. Remove lid and cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. </li>
